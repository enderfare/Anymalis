# Core Principles

**Glyphs** are the fundamental symbols of magic, each representing a primal concept. Their **outlines** define how they interact with reality and with each other. Magic users manipulate these outlines to produce effects.

**Birthmarks & Affinity:** Every magic-sensitive person is born with one elemental variant encoded as a birthmark-glyph. This determines their innate elemental affinity and influences their magical capabilities.

## Ten Outline Types

1. **Foundation Outline** - Basic shape, determines elemental affinity
2. **Reaction Outline** - How glyph interacts with other glyphs
3. **Amplification Outline** - Increases power/scale of effect
4. **Precision Outline** - Focuses effect on specific target/area
5. **Duration Outline** - Determines how long effect lasts
6. **Trigger Outline** - Sets conditions for activation
7. **Containment Outline** - Limits/contains the magical effect
8. **Transformation Outline** - Changes nature of effect over time
9. **Connection Outline** - Links multiple glyphs together
10. **Resonance Outline** - Creates harmonic/sympathetic effects

## System Mechanics

**Glyph Combination:** By stacking or interlocking outlines, practitioners can create complex spells. For example:
- Fire glyph with Precision + Amplification outlines = Focused laser-like flame
- Water glyph with Duration + Transformation outlines = Water that gradually turns to ice

**Affinity Advantages:** Those born with a specific elemental variant:
- Require less energy to use that element
- Can achieve more subtle effects with their element
- Have intuitive understanding of their element's properties
- Their birthmark sometimes glows/reacts when using their affinity element

**Limitations:**
- Using elements outside one's affinity requires significantly more energy
- Overuse of magic causes "glyph fatigue" - temporary inability to focus on outlines
- Opposing elements (Light/Darkness, Life/Death, Fire/Water) are difficult for one person to master simultaneously

## Example Character

**Name:** Elara
**Birthmark:** A spiraling glyph on her left shoulder resembling flowing water
**Elemental Variant:** Water - "Flow" variant
**Affinity Effects:** Can manipulate currents with minimal effort, sense water movement nearby, stay hydrated more easily

**Spell Example:** 
Elara combines her Flow glyph with:
- Precision Outline (to target a specific plant)
- Duration Outline (to water it slowly over hours)
- Transformation Outline (to add trace nutrients)

The stacked outlines create a gentle, nourishing irrigation spell that helps the plant grow stronger than normal watering would.

## Cultural Significance

Those with rare, low-variant elements (Light, Darkness, Time, Death) are often viewed with awe or fear. Their birthmarks are considered marks of destiny. Schools of magic categorize students by their birthmark glyphs, and arranged marriages sometimes consider glyph compatibility for producing children with desirable elemental affinities.

The system creates natural societal roles:
- Earth (Clay/Soil) variants as potters and farmers
- Water (Healing/Spring) variants as doctors
- Wind (Whisper/Current) variants as messengers
- Fire (Hearth/Ember) variants as smiths and cooks
- Time (Flow/Still) variants as historians and strategists
